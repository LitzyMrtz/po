  <h1> Gaza and Isreal War </h1>
  
<br>
  
  <h4>What is it?</h4>
  <p>It is a war happening currently between Isreal and Gaza. The war has been going on for a long time, since October 7, 2023.The Gaza Strip has almost always played a pivotal part in the region's political dynamics, as well as its age-old struggles over religion and military power. The Gaza Strip is a region that has been occupied by Israel for more than a century</p>
  <br>
  <h4> What is gaza?</h4>
  <p>Gaza is a small,25-mile strip of Palestinian land where isreal has trapped Palestinians under a brutal and illegal siege for 16 years and violent military rule for over 56 years. It is the size of Detroit but with 4 times the people.Seattle and Detroit are fewer than 2 square miles larger than Gaza, not including their suburbs and satellite cities. </p>

  <p>Over 2 million Palestinains live in Gaza, half of whom are children. The majority of Gaza's populatio are Pelstinian refugees who were violently forced out of their ancestral homes by Isreal and pushed into Gza. Now, becasue of Isreal's bombs, many in Gaza are losiung their homes agian.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>What is currently happening?</h4>
   <p>Since october 7, Isreal has been bombing gaza indiscrimenatlly targeting hospitals, schools, apartment buildings, marketplaces, and more while totally sutting off water, food and electrivity leaving the people of Gaza to survive with basically nothing but pain on thier side.</p>
  <p>The UNHR report, released in mid-May, concludes thst Israel has committed genocidal acts, namely killing, seriously harming, and inflicting conditions of life calculated, and intended to, bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza. "A textbook case of genecide" according to genecide exports is what is happening. With reason they say this because as of october 17 in 2023, Isreal has killed over 2,750 Pelstinains, including more tham 1,000 children. Some of those children were children stuck, left behind in hospitals or already dead from being cut off from food, water and electricity that would monitor thier heart beat or oxygen.</p>

  <h4>History</h4>
  <p>The conflict between Gaza and Israel is complex and longstanding, with roots in historical, political, and religious tensions.</p>
  <p>The conflict dates back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the rise of Jewish nationalism (Zionism) and Arab nationalism in the region.
In 1948, Israel declared independence, leading to a war with neighboring Arab states and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, known as the Nakba (catastrophe).<p/>
  <p>The territory known as Gaza came under Egyptian control, while the West Bank was occupied by Jordan.
  </p>
<p>Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and Sinai Peninsula.
  Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have expanded, leading to ongoing disputes over land and resources.</p>
  <p>Gaza came under Israeli occupation until 2005 when Israel withdrew its settlers and military forces.
    However, Israel still controls Gaza's borders, airspace, and coastline, imposing a blockade that severely restricts the movement of people and goods. Hamas, an Islamist militant group, won legislative elections in Gaza in 2006 and seized control of the territory from the Palestinian Authority in 2007.
  <p/>
 <p> Israel, the United States, and the European Union classify Hamas as a terrorist organization due to its attacks against Israeli civilians and refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist.
The conflict between Israel and Gaza, often characterized by rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli airstrikes, has erupted into several major conflicts, notably in 2008-2009, 2012, 2014, and 2021.</p>
  <p>The conflicts have resulted in significant casualties, destruction, and humanitarian crises in Gaza, as well as casualties and fear among Israeli civilians.
Ceasefire agreements brokered by Egypt, the United Nations, and other mediators have temporarily halted the violence, but underlying issues remain unresolved.
The conflict has drawn international condemnation, with calls for a peaceful resolution, respect for human rights, and a two-state solution, whereby Israel and Palestine would coexist side by side.
Efforts to broker peace, including negotiations led by the United States, the United Nations, and regional powers, have so far failed to achieve a lasting settlement.

  <h4>How did this start?</h4>
  <p> Isreal has subjeced palestinians t dial violence for decades. In 1948, Isreal forced 75% of the entire palestinian populaioon out of their homes and off of their land. Isreal hasnt stopped oppressing them since. Palestinians call this the "Nakba", or the "catastrophe" in Arabic.</p>
  <p>The people in Gaza, the Palestinains want to live in freedom and safety om their own land, not having to worry about being killed or hurt by Isreal.They want freedom but are being denied that.
